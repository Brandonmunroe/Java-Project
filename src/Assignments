Write a function fizzBuzz which takes a single integer argument, it should iterate from 1
to the number (inclusive). During iteration if the current number is divisible by 3 print
Fizz, if its divisible by 5 print Buzz, if its divisible by both print FizzBuzz instead otherwise
just print the current number.
Example:
fizzBuzz(15):
1 2 Fizz 3 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz


2. Write a function stepsToZero which takes an integer argument, return the number of
steps to reduce that argument to zero. In one step if the current value is even the
number must be divided by 2, otherwise you must decrease it by 1
Example:
stepsToZero(30)
30 -> 15 -> 14 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
Answer: 8

3. Write a function powerOfTwo which takes an integer argument, it should return true if
the number is a power of two and return false if it is not
Example:
powerOfTwo(16) -> True
powerOfTwo(256) -> True
powerOfTwo(6) -> False
